# Nature & Animals (CURRENTLY WORKING)
This project will collect tweets from the specified users using the Twitter API. After that, Google Cloud Vision API, Google Cloud NLP and Stanford Core NLP will analyze both text and images from those Tweets and classify them into a Database

## How does it work?

This project uses both Twitter API and Google Cloud API, so you will need these two accounts and log in into the application in order to authenticate your user and access to the services.
Once you're logged in, get into the website
```
https://localhost:8083/
```
Where you'll find the Dashboard. Here you can see the result of the analysis of the last search. I if is the first time you open the app, you'll probably won't have any
infomation available, so go to the tab ***Search Tweets*** and configure your search
